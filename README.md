# nix-direnv

![Test](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

A faster, persistent implementation of `direnv`'s `use_nix`, to replace the built-in one.

Prominent features:

- significantly faster after the first run by caching the `nix-shell` environment
- prevents garbage collection of build dependencies by symlinking the resulting
  shell derivation in the user's `gcroots` (Life is too short to lose
  your project's build cache if you are on a flight with no internet connection)

## Installation

There are different ways to install nix-direnv, pick your favourite:

- via home-manager (recommended)
- via configuration.nix in NixOS
- with nix-env
- from source
- with direnv source_url

### Via home-manager

In `$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/home.nix` add

```Nix
{ pkgs, ... }:

{
  # ...other config, other config...

  programs.direnv.enable = true;
  programs.direnv.nix-direnv.enable = true;
  # optional for nix flakes support in home-manager 21.11, not required in home-manager unstable or 22.05
  programs.direnv.nix-direnv.enableFlakes = true;

  programs.bash.enable = true;
  # OR
  programs.zsh.enable = true;
  # Or any other shell you're using.
}
```

Optional: To protect your nix-shell against garbage collection you also need to add these options to your Nix configuration.

If you are on NixOS also add the following lines to your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```Nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  nix.extraOptions = ''
    keep-outputs = true
    keep-derivations = true
  '';
}
```

On other systems with Nix add the following configuration to your `/etc/nix/nix.conf`:

```
keep-derivations = true
keep-outputs = true
```

### Via configuration.nix in NixOS

In `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```Nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ direnv nix-direnv ];
  # nix options for derivations to persist garbage collection
  nix.extraOptions = ''
    keep-outputs = true
    keep-derivations = true
  '';
  environment.pathsToLink = [
    "/share/nix-direnv"
  ];
  # if you also want support for flakes (this makes nix-direnv use the
  # unstable version of nix):
  nixpkgs.overlays = [
    (self: super: { nix-direnv = super.nix-direnv.override { enableFlakes = true; }; } )
  ];
}
```

Then source the `direnvrc` from this repository in your own `$HOME/.direnvrc`

```bash
# put this in ~/.direnvrc
source /run/current-system/sw/share/nix-direnv/direnvrc
```

### With nix-env

As **non-root** user do the following:

```console
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nix-direnv
```

Then add nix-direnv to `$HOME/.direnvrc`:

```bash
source $HOME/.nix-profile/share/nix-direnv/direnvrc
```

You also need to set `keep-outputs` and `keep-derivations` to nix.conf as described in the installation
via home-manager section.

### From source

Clone the repository to some directory

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv $HOME/nix-direnv
```

Then source the direnvrc from this repository in your own `.direnvrc`

```bash
# put this in ~/.direnvrc
source $HOME/nix-direnv/direnvrc
```

You also need to set `keep-outputs` and `keep-derivations` to nix.conf as described in the installation
via home-manager section.

### Direnv source_url

Put the following lines in your `.envrc`:

```bash
if ! has nix_direnv_version || ! nix_direnv_version 1.5.1; then
  source_url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/1.5.1/direnvrc" "sha256-p4CDMJjuBmEh9pkn2aoJrZqr0DlPZHPU7eXOSDzzcuo="
fi
```

## Usage example

Either add `shell.nix` or a `default.nix` to the same directory:

``` nix
# save this as shell.nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}}:

pkgs.mkShell {
  nativeBuildInputs = [ pkgs.hello ];
}
```

Then add the line `use nix` to your envrc:
```console
$ echo "use nix" >> .envrc
$ direnv allow
```

If you haven't used direnv before, make sure to [hook it into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) first.

### Using a non-standard file name
You may use a different file name than `shell.nix` or `default.nix` by passing the file name in `.envrc`, e.g.:
```console
$ echo "use nix foo.nix" >> .envrc
```

### Overriding nix-direnv's caching

nix-direnv adds an additional layer of caching on top of direnv,
whereby the created `devShell` environment itself is cached.

This environment can become invalidated in a number of ways.
nix-direnv makes an attempt at telling if the `devShell` must be recreated,
but cannot always keep up due to the generality of how nix may be spread over a repository.

To assist in invaliding the cache when necessary,
users can add a function to specify when to invalidate the cache.

**Before invoking either `use flake` or `use nix` in your `.env` or `.envrc`**,
you can define a function called `nix_direnv_cache_is_valid`.

`nix_direnv_cache_is_valid` takes one argument,
the path to a cache file,
and should return non-zero if the `devShell` is to be considered invalid.

The cache file's mtime can be compared against
to determine if any watched file is newer than the cache.

Note that this function is not an override.
The default tracking that nix-direnv provides is kept when defining `nix_direnv_cache_is_valid`.

#### Examples

In `.envrc`:

```sh
function nix_direnv_cache_is_valid() {
  # exit non-zero if any nix file in the project is newer than the cache
  find . -name "*.nix" -newer "$1" -exec false {} .
}
```

of if you want to track a single additional file:

```sh
function nix_direnv_cache_is_valid() {
  test "./nix/default.nix" -nt "$1"
}
```


## Flakes support

nix-direnv also comes with a flake alternative. The code is tested and works however
since future nix versions might change their api regarding this feature we cannot
guarantee stability after an nix upgrade.
Likewise `use_nix` the `use_flake` implementation will prevent garbage
collection of downloaded packages and also for flake inputs.

You can run `nix flake new -t github:nix-community/nix-direnv` to get [this](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/tree/master/template) project template.
or just add:

```
$ echo "use flake" >> .envrc
$ direnv allow
```

in case the project already comes with a `flake.nix`.
Optionally if you do not want `flake.nix` to be part of the current directory repo,
you can specify an arbitrary flake expression as parameter such as:

```console
use flake ~/myflakes#project
```

### Advanced usage

Under the covers, `use_flake` calls `nix print-dev-env`.
The first argument to the `use_flake` function is the flake expression to use,
and all other arguments are proxied along to the call to `print-dev-env`.
You may make use of this fact for some more arcane invocations.

For instance, if you have a flake that needs to be called impurely under some conditions,
you may wish to pass `--impure` to the `print-dev-env` invocation
so that the environment of the calling shell is passed in.

You can do that as follows:

```
$ echo "use flake . --impure" > .envrc
$ direnv allow
```

## Storing .direnv outside the project directory

A `.direnv` directory will be created in each `use_nix` project, which might
interact badly with backups (e.g. Dropbox) or IDEs.

Therefore it's possible to override a function called `direnv_layout_dir` in
`$HOME/.config/direnv/direnvrc` or in each project's `.envrc`.

The following example will create a unique directory name per project
in `$HOME/.cache/direnv/layouts/`:

```bash
# $HOME/.config/direnv/direnvrc
: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:=$HOME/.cache}
declare -A direnv_layout_dirs
direnv_layout_dir() {
    echo "${direnv_layout_dirs[$PWD]:=$(
        echo -n "$XDG_CACHE_HOME"/direnv/layouts/
        echo -n "$PWD" | shasum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
    )}"
}
```
During direnv setup `direnv_layout_dir` can be called multiple times and with different values of `$PWD`
(when other `.envrc` files are included). Therefore cache its results in dictionary `direnv_layout_dirs`.

## Manually re-triggering evaluation

In some case nix-direnv does not detect if imported file has changed and still
provides the old cached values. An evaluation can be triggered by updating your
`default.nix`, `shell.nix` or `flake.nix`, depending on what is used:

```console
# choose one
$ touch default.nix
$ touch shell.nix
$ touch flake.nix
```

## Shell integration

To quickly add a `default.nix`/`flake.nix` to a project you can put the following snippets in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:

```bash
nixify() {
  if [ ! -e ./.envrc ]; then
    echo "use nix" > .envrc
    direnv allow
  fi
  if [[ ! -e shell.nix ]] && [[ ! -e default.nix ]]; then
    cat > default.nix <<'EOF'
with import <nixpkgs> {};
mkShell {
  nativeBuildInputs = [
    bashInteractive
  ];
}
EOF
    ${EDITOR:-vim} default.nix
  fi
}

flakify() {
  if [ ! -e flake.nix ]; then
    nix flake new -t github:nix-community/nix-direnv .
  elif [ ! -e .envrc ]; then
    echo "use flake" > .envrc
    direnv allow
  fi
  ${EDITOR:-vim} flake.nix
}

```

## Known Bugs

At the moment `nix-direnv` depends on GNU Grep and a modern Bash version.
This might lead to [problems](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv/issues/3) on macOS.
As a work-around we suggest that macOS users install `direnv`/`grep` via Nix or Homebrew.

## Why not use `lorri` instead?

- nix-direnv has flakes support.
- High CPU load/resource usage in some cases: When nixpkgs in `NIX_PATH` is
  pointed to a directory, i.e. a git checkout, Lorri will try to evaluate
  nixpkgs everytime something changes causing high cpu load. Nix-direnv
  compromises between performance and correctness, and only re-evaluates direnv
  if either the project-specific `default.nix` / `shell.nix` changes, or if
  there is a new commit added to `nixpkgs`. A re-evaluation can be also
  triggered by using `touch .envrc` in the same project.
  A different problem is that it might trigger mass-rebuilds when the same nixpkgs
  checkout is pointed to something like staging.
- No additional daemon or services required: The codesize is small enough that it can be vendored
  into a project itself.
